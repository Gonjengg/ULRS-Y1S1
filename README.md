# ULRS-Y1S1

It has been inspiring to study abouut this subject. The course highlighted the value of individual responsibility in addition to offering facts about the negative effects of corruption. My awareness of moral problems has increased as a result of learning this subject. All things considered, this subject has given me a sense of obligation to maintain integrity in both my personal and professional life, helping to create a society that is more moral and responsible.
